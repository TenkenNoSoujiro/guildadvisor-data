# Instructions

To add a unit, make a copy of an existing unit or use one of the two template files at the root of this repository.

The `"id"` for any unit is something the Discord bot uses to distinguish between each unit, and must be unique.
The format is usually `name-title`, where any whitespace becomes a `.` and any punctuation is just removed. 

For example `[Honor Succession] Bell Cranel` becomes `bell.cranel-honor.succession`.
